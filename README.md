JavaScript Learning Notes:

Objects

-Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the bricks that data structures are built from. But you can’t make much of a house out of a single brick. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—together and thus build more complex structures.

- Objects are passed around by reference.They are never copied.

- JavaScript includes a prototype linkage feature that allows one object to inherit the properties of another.Whn used well, this can reduce object initialization time and memory consumption.

- every object is linked to prototype object from which it can inherit properties.Akk objects created from object literals are linked to Object.prototype- an object that comes standard with JavaScript.

-The binary 'in' operator, when applied to a string and an object, returns a Boolean value that indicates whether that object has that property.
