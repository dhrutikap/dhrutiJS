JavaScript Learning Notes:
Objects
- JavaScript includes a prototype linkage feature that allows one object to inherit the properties of another.Whn used well, this can reduce object initialization time and memory consumption.

-Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the bricks that data structures are built from. But you can’t make much of a house out of a single brick. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—together and thus build more complex structures.
